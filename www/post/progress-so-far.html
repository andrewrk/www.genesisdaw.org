I started working on Genesis in March 2013. The first commit:

<p>
Yes, that's right. I thought I was going to write it in Go.
</p>
<p>
This turned out to be a bad idea. Here's why:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go is garbage collected, which makes its performance characteristics less predictable -
    a serious problem with real-time audio processing.
  </li>
  <li>
    I would have to write an abstraction layer between any C libraries and Go code.
  </li>
  <li>
    Other people who want to re-use Genesis library code would be forced to use Go or
    be out of luck.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Sure enough the next thing I tried to do was use a GTK Go-binding library and find it
  broken and inadequate.
</p>
<p>
  I fiddled with that for a bit and then lost enthusiasm. But I picked up the project in
  January 2014:

    switching to C++ and Qt. main window, does nothing
</pre>
<p>
Qt solves a lot of platform abstraction for the programmer. You might even say it solves <em>too much</em>.
The downside is that it is a hulking behemoth of a dependency with a nontrivial build process.
But, it enabled me to make some windows and fiddle around with some code.
</p>
<p>
I added the ability to list <a href="http://lv2plug.in/">LV2 plugins</a> and open a
<a href="http://www.portaudio.com/">PortAudio</a> stream.
</p>
<p>
During this time I came up with some feature requirements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Never require the user to restart the program.</li>
  <li>Robust undo/redo support.</li>
  <li>Ability to edit multiple projects at once. Copy and paste between them.</li>
  <li>Support for N audio channels instead of hardcoded stereo.</li>
  <li>Tight integration with an online sample/project sharing service. Make it
      really easy to save the project open source.
  </li>
  <li><strong>multiplayer support</strong> - Each person can be editing a different section.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  And then I lost interest for a while. I spent a lot of time working on
  <a href="https://github.com/andrewrk/groovebasin">GrooveBasin</a>, prototyped a
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdumpgdooMc">Grappling Hook-Based Video Game</a>,
  and entered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4up9g0I7dHI">Ludum Dare 30</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In November 2014, progress resumed. Well, for some definitions of progress:

<p>
Rust seemed like a cool alternative to C++ because it had fancy new programming language features
like <em>not requiring .h files</em>. More seriously, the 3 problems with using Go are resolved with
Rust, since it can call C code directly, C code can call it, and there is no garbage collector.
Further, the safety guarantees it made were promising.
</p>
<p>
But nothing in life is free. GTK is sufficiently complicated that a Rust "safety wrapper" is in order.
The one available was not complete.
</p>
<p>
At this time I began to have a new philosophy: <em>Stop depending on libraries that hold the project down.</em>
</p>
<p>
This led me to ditch the idea of using GTK or Qt and instead code the user interface toolkit from scratch.
This would work out better anyway if I wanted to sandbox plugins and provide a user-interface API for them
to use.

    goodbye GTK, hello SDL2
</pre>
<p>
  Wait, never mind, let's try GLFW.
</p>
<pre class="brush: diff">

    goodbye SDL2, hello GLFW
</pre>
<p>
  At this point I felt like I needed a direction, something to work towards. So I created a goal:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open an audio file with libav.</li>
  <li>Display the waveform of the audio file in the display.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Next I began to experience Rust development. I went back and forth between GLFW and glutin for
  window library as one or the other seemed to be better.
  I created <a href="https://github.com/andrewrk/groove-rs">groove-rs</a> - bindings to
  <a href="https://github.com/andrewrk/libgroove">libgroove</a>.
  I wrote my own
  <a href="https://github.com/andrewrk/math3d-rs">3D math library</a> because
  the <a href="https://github.com/sebcrozet/nalgebra">existing one</a>'s API was too hard for me to understand.
  I fixed a lot of code after updating to the latest Rust compiler each day.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I got font rendering working. It took me 16 days, but I felt like I had learned enough
  about Rust to finally let me develop efficiently.
</p>
<img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/genesisdaw.org/img/rust-font-rendering-ok.png">
<p>
  And then I tried to abstract the font rendering code into a widget concept, and everything broke down.
  The Rust compiler has many false negatives - situations where it is a compile error due to safety,
  but actually it's pretty obvious that there are no safety problems.
</p>
<p>
  This is so frustrating and demotivating that I realized the benefits of Rust did not outweigh
  the slow development pace that I had taken on.

    rust is too hard

    delete all code, switch to C++
</pre>
<p>
  I felt guilty for allowing myself get distracted from actually making progress all this time.
  From now on I would be lazer focused and in general avoid depending on other people's code.
  If it's a bug in my code, then I know how to fix it. New roadmap:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Load all the audio file's channels into memory.</li>
  <li>Display all of the audio file's channels in a list.</li>
  <li>Render channels graphically.</li>
  <li>Ability to make a selection.</li>
  <li>Playback to speakers.</li>
  <li>Delete selection.</li>
  <li>Undo/Redo</li>
  <li>Multiplayer</li>
</ol>
<p>
  So I knew I would be switching to C++. But I did not want to fall into the same trap in C++-land
  that I did in Rust-land: instead of solving the actual problem of making a DAW, trying to understand
  how Rust or C++ works and get my code to compile.
</p>
<p>
  I considered switching to C instead of C++. Linus Torvalds has 
  <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linus">some things to say about that</a>.
</p>
<p>
  But some C++ features are too good to ignore, such as template data structures. For example, in C
  if you want to create a list data structure, you have 3 options:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make it generic using preprocessor directives.</li>
  <li>Make it generic using <code>void *</code> instead of actual types.</li>
  <li>Don't make it generic. Reimplement the same data structure over and over for each type.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This sucks. Preprocessor directives are the devil, Too much <code>void *</code> leads to
  runtime memory safety errors that the compiler can't catch. And what if it wasn't a simple list
  data structure, but instead a hash table or something? This is crazy, we can't reimplement the
  same data structure a bunch of times.
</p>
<p>
Another example. In C you use <code>malloc</code> to allocate memory. It typically looks something
like <code>malloc(sizeof(MyType) * count)</code>. If you forget to multiply by count or sizeof, oops.
segfault. Meanwhile if you can use templates then you can define a function like this:
</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp">
template&lt;typename T&gt;
__attribute__((malloc)) static inline T * allocate(size_t count) {
    return reinterpret_cast&lt;T*&gt;(malloc(count * sizeof(T)));
}
</pre>
<p>
  Now you can't mess it up, the compiler does the work for you.
</p>
<p>
So I wanted templates from C++. And <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic">atomics</a>
from C++11. But that's about it. Other than that, I want to code like I'm in C. The beauty of C-style
coding is that the control flow is so simple, it's impossible to not know what code is doing. Contrast
that with fancy C++ stuff and you never know what's going to happen or what each line of code is going
to do.
</p>
<p>
I figured out how to have my cake and eat it too. I discovered that you can compile with g++
and link with gcc, like so:
</p>
<pre>
g++ -nodefaultlibs -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -std=c++11 -c main.cpp -o main.o
gcc -o main main.o
</pre>
<p>
As long as you don't use anything from the C++ standard library, you end up with working code
that was compiled with the C++ compiler and does not depend on libstdc++.
</p>
<p>
With clang it's even easier, just don't put <code>-lstdc++</code> on the linker line.
</p>
<p>
So I moved on, happy with this choice of language. Over the course of <strong>4 days</strong>, I implemented,
<em>with useful, reusable abstractions</em>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A UTF-8 encoder/decoder and String class.</li>
  <li>OpenGL shaders for text rendering.</li>
  <li>A hash table implementation with robin hood hashing.</li>
  <li>A Label graphics class to render text, which uses FreeType to load a TTF file and caches
      rendered symbols in a hash table.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
At this point I felt crazy for even considering Rust. I had accomplished more in 4 days what took me
16 days in Rust. But more importantly, my abstractions were holding up.
