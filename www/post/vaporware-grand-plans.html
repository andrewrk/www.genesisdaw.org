<h3>Real-Time Safety and Multithreading</h3>

<p>
Most operating systems do not attempt to make any real-time guarantees. This
means that various operations do not guarantee a maximum bound on how long it
might take. For example, when you allocate memory, it might be very quick, or
the kernel might have to do some memory defragmentation and cache invalidation
to make room for your new segment of memory. Writing to a hard drive might
cause it to have to warm up and start spinning.
</p>

<p>
This can be a disaster if one of these non-bounded operations is in the
audio rendering pipeline, especially if the latency is low. The buffer of audio
going to the sound card might empty before it gets filled up, causing a nasty
audio glitch sound known as a "buffer underrun".
</p>

<p>
In general, all syscalls are suspect when it comes to real-time guarantees. The
careful audio programmer will avoid them all.
</p>

<p>
libgenesis meets this criteria with one exception. libgenesis takes advantage
of hardware concurrency by using one worker thread per CPU core to render
audio. It carefully uses a lock-free queue data structure to avoid making
syscalls, but when there is not enough work to do and some threads are sitting
idly by, those threads need to suspend execution until there is work to do.
</p>

<p>
So if there is more work to be done than worker threads, no syscalls are made.
However, if a worker thread has nothing to do and needs to suspend execution,
it makes a <code>FUTEX_WAIT</code> syscall, and then is woken up by another worker thread
making a <code>FUTEX_WAKE</code> syscall.
</p>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<p>
libgenesis follows <a href="http://semver.org/">semver</a>. Major version is bumped when
API or ABI compatibility is broken. Minor version is bumped when new features
are added. Patch version is bumped only for bug fixes. Until 1.0.0 is released
no effort is made toward backward compatibility whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
Genesis Audio Studio has an independent version from libgenesis. Major version
is bumped when a project file will no longer generate the same output audio as
the previous version. Minor version is bumped when new features are added.
Patch version is bumped only for bug fixes. Until 1.0.0 is released no effort
is made toward project files being backward compatible to previous versions.
</p>

<h3>Coordinates</h3>
<p>
Positions in the audio project are in <em>floating point whole notes</em>. This is to
take into account the fact that the tempo and time signature could change at
any point in the audio project. You can convert from whole notes to frames by
calling a utility function which takes into account tempo and time signature
changes.
</p>

<h3>Multiplayer and Peer-to-Peer</h3>

<p>
When a user opens Genesis, there should be a pane which has a set of rooms that
users can gather in and chat. For example, a lobby. Users can create other
rooms, perhaps private, to join as well. Users can invite other users to join
their open project. When a user joins the project, a peer-to-peer connection is
established so the edits do not go through a third party. Further, if the peers
are connected via LAN, network speeds will be very fast.
</p>

<p>
The server(s) that provide this chat are also peers. Individuals or businesses
could donate to the server space, similar to being a seeder in a torrent
situation, by running the server software, adding their node to the pool.
</p>

<p>
When two (or more) users are simultaneously working on a project, the playback
head is not synchronized. The users are free to roam about the project, making
changes here and there. However, each person will see "where" in the project
the other person is working, and see the changes that they are making. So it
would be trivial, for example, for both users to look at a particular bassline,
both listening to it on loop, albeit at different offsets, while one person
works on the drums, and the other person works on the bass rhythm.
</p>

<h3>Plugin Registry and Safety</h3>

<p>
Plugins must be provided as source code and published to the Genesis registry.
The Genesis registry will not be a single server, but once again a peer-to-peer
network. Downloading from the plugin registry will be like downloading a
torrent. By default Genesis will act as a peer on LANs when other instances of
Genesis request plugins over the LAN.
</p>

<p>
It's not clear how this goal will be accomplished, but we will attempt to build
a system where these constraints are met:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
   Plugins are provided as source code that is guaranteed to build on all
   supported platforms. It's not possible to have a plugin that works on one
   person's computer and not another.
  </li>
  <li>
   Plugins either have compile-time protection against malicious code and
   crashes (such as segfaults) or run-time protection.
  <ul>
      <li>
     One idea: instead of one sandboxed process per plugin, have one sandboxed
     process that runs all the untrusted plugin code; the entire real-time
     execution path.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
DRM will never be supported although paid plugins are not out of the question,
as long as the constraint is met that if a user wants another user to join their
project, the other user is able to use the plugin with no restrictions.
</p>

<h3>Project Network</h3>

<p>
Users could browse published projects and samples on the peer-to-peer network.
A sample is a rendered project, so if you want to edit the source to the sample
you always can.
</p>

<p>
Publishing a project requires licensing it generously so that it is always safe
to use projects on the network for any purpose without restriction.
</p>

<p>
The network would track downloads and usages so that users can get an idea of
popularity and quality. Projects would be categorized and tagged and related to
each other for easy browsing and searchability.
</p>

<p>
So, one user might publish some drum samples that they made as projects, one
project per sample. Another user might use all of them, edit one of them and
modify the effects, and then create 10 projects which are drum loops using the
samples. A third user might use 2-3 of these drum loops, edit them to modify
the tempo, and produce a song with them and publish the song. Yet another user
might edit the song, produce a remix, and then publish the remix.
</p>

<p>
This project, sample, and plugin network should be easily browsable directly
from the Genesis user interface. It should be very easy to use content from the
network, and equally easy to publish content <em>to</em> the network. It should almost
be easier to save it open source than to save it privately.
</p>

<h3>License</h3>
<p>
Genesis is licensed with the Lesser General Public License. A full copy of the
license text is included in the LICENSE file, but here's a non-normative
summary:
</p>
<p>
As a user you have access to the source code, and if you are willing to compile
from source yourself, you can get the software for free.
</p>
<p>
As a company you may freely use the source code in your software; the only
restriction is that if you modify Genesis source code, you must contribute those
modifications back to the Genesis project.
