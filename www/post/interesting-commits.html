    RingBuffer implementation
</pre>
<p>
I use <code>mmap</code> to put the same slice of memory in two places so that
each write and read from the ring buffer only takes one <code>memcpy</code>.

    alright C++ you win. gimme dat inheritance
</pre>
<p>
When working on widget user interface code, I realized that I was implementing inheritence
without actually using C++'s inheritance features, and it was more error prone than just
giving in and depending on libstdc++.
</p>
<p>
The core backend and the GUI are decoupled. The core backend is in a shared
library called libgenesis which does not link against any GUI-related
libraries - not even libstdc++.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the GUI depends on libgenesis and puts a user-interface on top of it.
</p>
<p>
libgenesis is intended to be a general-purpose utility library for doing
digital audio workstation related things, such as using it as the backend for
a headless computer-created music stream.

    32-bit floats in memory instead of 64
</pre>
<p>
I'm still not sure about this one. I've read some conflicting things about whether to
use 32-bit float or 64-bit float for audio processing.
</p>
<p>
I made this commit when I found out that JACK uses exclusively 32-bit floats for audio
samples.

    GLFW instead of SDL2
</pre>
<p>
I experienced 2 issues with SDL:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/andrewrk/genesis/issues/1">home button doesn't work on some keyboards</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/andrewrk/genesis/issues/2">keyboard shortcuts ignore keyboard layout</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="http://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a> has a narrower focus and smaller footprint.
I hoped that this meant the bug surface area would be smaller.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, it has the same bugs. However it is under more active development with a faster release schedule,
and less bloat in between Genesis and the hardware is nice.
</p>
<p>
Next I got a <code>list_devices</code> example program working:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./list_devices 
playback device: 44100 Hz GK104 HDMI Audio Controller Digital Stereo (HDMI)
playback device: 44100 Hz Built-in Audio Analog Stereo (default)
recording device: 44100 Hz Monitor of GK104 HDMI Audio Controller Digital Stereo (HDMI)
recording device: 44100 Hz Monitor of Built-in Audio Analog Stereo
recording device: 44100 Hz Built-in Audio Analog Stereo (default)
controller device: Midi Through Port-0 (default)
6 devices found
</pre>
<p>
And a <code>normalize_audio</code> example which reads an audio file of any format,
increases the volume as much as possible without clipping, and then saves to any format.
This demonstrates the audio import and export capabilities.
</p>
<pre>
$ ./normalize_audio ~/tmp/quiet.ogg ~/tmp/out.flac
Channels: 2 (Stereo)
222208 frames (5.04 seconds)
Amplification factor: 18.638
out codec: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec)
out sample format: signed 24-bit integer
out sample rate: 44100
