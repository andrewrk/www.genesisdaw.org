  As a music producer, it's hard to find the line between creativity and
  blindly reusing other people's work. If you use presets from a synthesizer,
  you're using someone else's synth programming. If you use someone else's synth,
  you're using someone else's Digital Signal Processing code. You can purchase
  melodies and chord progressions from a MIDI store. You can use sample packs for
  musical instruments that somebody else recorded. You can use pre-made drum loops.
</p>
<p>
  At each step along the way, it becomes less clear what your role is in the creation
  process. 
</p>
<p>
  I have decided to solve the problem by adding restrictions
  to the creative process. These restrictions include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use only samples that I personally have recorded with a microphone.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use only synthesizers that I personally have coded the DSP and programmed the presets.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use only DAW software that I personally have coded, including recording
    software for recording samples.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use only melodies and chord progressions that I personally have created.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The music I release under these restrictions will be associated with the artist name <strong>Bit Trouper</strong>.
</p>
<p>
 Google gives 2 definitions for <em>trouper</em>:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>an actor or other entertainer, typically one with long experience.</li>
  <li>a reliable and uncomplaining person.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  So now it's time to build a Digital Audio Workstation. I'm calling it <strong>Genesis</strong>.
