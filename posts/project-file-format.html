The first 16 bytes of every Genesis project file are:
</p>
<pre>
ca2f 5ef5 00d8 ef0b 8074 18d0 e40b 7a4f
</pre>
<p>
I got this from <code>/dev/random</code>.
This uniquely identifies the file as a Genesis project file. The default file
extension is <code>.gdaw</code>.
</p>
<p>
After this contains an ordered list of transactions. A <strong>transaction</strong> is a set of
<strong>edits</strong>. There are 2 types of edits: put and delete.
</p>
<p>
A <strong>put</strong> contains a key and a value, each of which is a variable number of bytes.
A <strong>delete</strong> contains only a key, which is a variable number of bytes.
</p>

<p>
A transaction looks like this:
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Offset</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>uint32be length of transaction in bytes including this field</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>uint32be crc32 of this transaction</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>uint32be number of put edits in this transaction</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>uint32be number of delete edits in this transaction</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>the put edits in this transaction</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>the delete edits in this transaction</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
A put edit looks like:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Offset</th><th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td><td>uint32be key length in bytes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td><td>uint32be value length in bytes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8</td><td>key bytes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-</td><td>value bytes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
A delete edit looks like:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Offset</th><th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td><td>uint32be key length in bytes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td><td>key bytes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
That's it. To read the file, apply the transactions in order. To update a file,
append a transaction. Periodically "garbage collect" by creating a new project
file with a single transaction with all the data, and then atomically rename
the new project file over the old one.
