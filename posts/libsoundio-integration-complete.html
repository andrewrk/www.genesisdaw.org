<p>I am pleased to report that libsoundio integration is complete and it has
indeed solved the buffer underrun problems and other issues I was running
into before.

In this screenshot you can see that Genesis is connected to multiple sound
drivers at once - JACK, PulseAudio, ALSA, and Dummy. On top of that it is
listening and will automatically refresh when you insert or remove a device
such as a USB microphone.
