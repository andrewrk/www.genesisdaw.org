I've been experimenting with broadcasting myself coding Genesis live.
Here are some
<a href="https://www.livecoding.tv/andrewrk/videos/">archived videos</a>.
In these videos we worked on:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Move audio graph code out of project code.</li>
  <li>Prepare codebase for ability to render project.</li>
  <li>Fix memory leaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you, like me, do not have Flash installed, you can use the excellent
<a href="http://docs.livestreamer.io/">livestreamer</a> project to
view the content.
</p>

I think I'm going to try to start doing these streams daily.
I'm not really sure where to announce when the stream starts. I'll try
twitter. My username is
